# Home_Sales
module 22 challenge
## Dataset
Given by Bootcamp
## Overview
Utilizing PySpark to perform SQL commands to answer questions regarding the home sales csv while also testing and comparing the runtime of cached, uncached, and partitioned dataframe. I found that uncached and partitioned dataframe's runtime is similar, and the cached runtime is longer than both.
